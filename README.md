# A3
Assisting Android API Migrations Using Code Examples

# Notes
Due to GitHub size limitations we could not host the FDroid apps used on this repo, however, we have provided links for all of the app repositories used for this project in each of the relevant folders. All apps were originally cloned on July 10 2018, and should be fetched with that date in mind to obtain comparable data.

# Regarding the tool
The tool (A3) used to collect the information presented in our paper A3: Assisting Android API Migrations Using Code Examples, will be made available in this repository upon acceptance of the paper.
